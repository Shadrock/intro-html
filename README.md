## Learning Lab Repository for Intro to HTML

I found [this tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html) to be frustrating and confusing: and I'm a "power user". Will suggest it for those students extremely comfortable with Ghub branches and commits, but for everybody else, I think it's best to stick with the McGlone tutorial.

# Yeah it was terrible.
Blah blah blah...
